        <h2>More about his life</h2>
        <div class="tribute-info">
         <p>Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo, Georgia. He was the youngest of five children born to Mallie (McGriff) and Jerry Robinson, after siblings Edgar, Frank, Matthew (nicknamed "Mack"), and Willa Mae.</p>
         <p>Robinson was a multi sport athlete his entire life. After graduating high school and attending Pasadena Junior College he enrolled at UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.</p>
         <p>In 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas and served in the military until being honorably discharged in 1944.</p>
         <p>Robinson's professional baseball career began in early 1945 when he signed a contract with the Kansas City Monarchs. He spent time playing for the Kansas City Monarchs and in minor league system until 1947. </p>
         <p>In 1947, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season. On April 15, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black. Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory. Robinson became the first player since 1884 to openly break the major league baseball color line.</p>
         <p>Robinson's major league career ended in game 7 of the 1956 World Series. After retirement, he went on to become an executive at Chock full o'Nuts.</p>
         <p>On October 24, 1972, Robinson died of a heart attack at his home on 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut; he was 53 years old.</p>
         <p>In 1997, MLB retired his uniform number 42 across all major league teams; he was the first professional athlete in any sport to be so honored.</p>
         <p>MLB also adopted a new annual tradition, "Jackie Robinson Day", for the first time on April 15, 2004, on which every player on every team wears No. 42.</p>
